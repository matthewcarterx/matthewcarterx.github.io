The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic makers, formulators, service, suppliers, and suppliers.</p>
<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest reliable dose when other approaches of pest control have stopped working.
