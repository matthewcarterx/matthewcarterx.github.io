<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of large, costly homes, so pest control costs might be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
