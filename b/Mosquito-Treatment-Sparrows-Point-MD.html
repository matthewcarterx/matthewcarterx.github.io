<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a number of the very same principles as IPM however limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>Utilizing natural enemies as a curative control is less successful compared to using them preventively. Employ appropriate hunting strategies and treatment decisions to protect the advantageous insects that can provide additional bug pest control. Thoroughly keep track of fields for all pests to figure out the requirement for remedial insecticide treatments. Now long term effective pest control is readily available on your fingertips.</p>
