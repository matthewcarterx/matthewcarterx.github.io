<p>Chemical pest control, especially space fumigation, tends to work best for severe problems.

Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; keep in mind, do not eliminate the helpful insects. However the exterminators not just help you in eliminating the pests from your house, however they ensure the pests will not return. IPM stresses using non-chemical control methods, such as exclusion or trapping, before chemical alternatives.</p>

Sovereign Pest Control and its associated companies supply quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 house owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee. </p>
