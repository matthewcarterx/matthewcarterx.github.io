<p>It is a community method to crop production and protection that combines different management techniques and practices to grow healthy crops and minimise the use of pesticides. IPM coordinates the use of pest biology, ecological information, and offered innovation to avoid inappropriate levels of pest damage by the most cost-effective ways, while decreasing risk to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>The determination of the right cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.
