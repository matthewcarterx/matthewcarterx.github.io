A single spotting of any pest in a warehouse throughout an audit can imply a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your belongings with hazardous chemicals, ruin the air quality in your house or business, potentially contaminate food and other perishables, and just eliminates pests at the surface of the issue.</p>

However by focusing on non-chemical choices first, you can guarantee that your pest management program is effectively removing pests at the least risk to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
