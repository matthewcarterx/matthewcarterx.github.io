<p>Unsure how to get rid of cockroaches? Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household pest pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly solely about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of insect stays inside the crop residue and can be controlled by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, but artificial pesticides stay a dominant strategy in managing pests.

<p>The decision of the right cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest.
