<p>We historically have actually offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods in addition to its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds.

<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies a number of the very same principles as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides. </p>
