Called wood-eating insects, termites are among the worst pests to encounter.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, VladÃ©s et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits containing poisonous material will attract and kill the pests when distributed in the field or positioned in traps. </p>
