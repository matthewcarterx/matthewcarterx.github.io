<p>Below ground termites live underground and build tunnels, also referred to as mud tubes", to reach food sources. The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" developed over a duration of about 10 years, generally amongst researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses.

<p>Correct scouting also offers information that assist to measure the development of pests and natural opponents. In time, with the glue-board monitoring program and bug submissions, the committee will become familiar with the kinds of pests encountered in the structure and the dynamics of the populations.

<p>Common pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so excruciating sometimes that the only choice left is to work with a local pest control company to remove pests.
