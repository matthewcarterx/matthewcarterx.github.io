In time, with the glue-board monitoring program and bug submissions, the committee will become familiar with the kinds of pests encountered in the structure and the dynamics of the populations.

<p>Common pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so excruciating sometimes that the only choice left is to work with a local pest control company to remove pests.
