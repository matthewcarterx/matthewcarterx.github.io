<p>Integrated pest management implies cautious consideration of all offered plant protection approaches and subsequent integration of suitable procedures that prevent the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep using plant protection items and other forms of intervention to levels that are financially and environmentally warranted and minimize or minimise threats to human health and the environment.</p>
