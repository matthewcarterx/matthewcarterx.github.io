<p>Biological pest control measures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary task is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control professionals even repair structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). Many pesticide problems are triggered by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
<p>A biological control program can succeed if these suggestions are followed: 1) correctly recognize all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural opponents from a reputable biological control supplier, 3) make sure there is a consistent supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) highlight that appropriate shipping procedures be followed, and 5) obtain directions from biological control providers on proper release rates and timing of application.</p>
