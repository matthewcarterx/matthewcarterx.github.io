<p>The term "integrated" was thus associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the expense of the control procedures.</p>

Where the danger of resistance against a plant defense procedure is understood and where the level of harmful organisms requires repeated application of pesticides to the crops, offered anti-resistance methods need to be applied to maintain the efficiency of the products. </p>
