<p>Think about alternative techniques (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly towards development of brand-new and better products with which to replace standard toxic pesticides.</p>
