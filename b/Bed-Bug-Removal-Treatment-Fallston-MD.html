<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" developed over a duration of about ten years, generally among researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are frequently monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which produces a homogenous environment often lacking key requirements of natural enemies, thus favoring pest species.</p>
<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control. After handling a number of nationwide chain exterminators and being mainly dissatisfied with the service, I turned to Terminators for assist with pest problems at my place of business. The idea of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests only when they start appearing and eliminating the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM techniques, Scope of works, application methods and industry particular record keeping procedures.</p>
<p>The application of insect pest control is the largest in the business & industrial sector due to the increasing requirement for expert pest control services, specifically for food manufacturing and hospitality sectors, to maintain a hygienic environment for the control of cockroaches, bedbugs, mosquitoes, and flies.
