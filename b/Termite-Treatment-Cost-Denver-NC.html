<p>The course will concentrate on the eco-friendly and management principles of pest control and you will learn to assess the effects of pesticide use and application on the biological target. The US EPA Biopesticides page consists of better details. Adoption of IPM can be seen under a continuum, beginning with systems mostly restricted to using a single tactical method such as utilizing economic limits for much better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a number of the exact same principles as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals.
