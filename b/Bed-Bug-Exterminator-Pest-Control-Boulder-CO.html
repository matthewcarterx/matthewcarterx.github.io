It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides may be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits adjust for modifications in market prices, phase of crop development, cost of pesticides, etc., but in reality most are based upon repaired infestation or damage levels.</p>

<p>Biological pest control measures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary job is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural enemies helps to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions.
